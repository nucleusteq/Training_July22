1 Variables or 
2 Char "we use char because char data type holds only one variable"
3 char[][] matrix= new int[11] [01]
	Scanner sc= new scanner;
	int class= sc.nextInt;
	int roll_num= sc.nextLine;
	System.out.println(int matrix[class][roll_num]);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int row=10,column=12;
        int matrix[][]=new int [row][column];

13 There are two ways we can create a thread in multithreading in java programs that is by extending thread class and implementing Runnable interface.
14 Avoid Unneccesaary locks ,Nested locks, using thread.join() method , use lock ordering ,locktime-out.
15 Quick fix and Mannually enable or disabled code.
