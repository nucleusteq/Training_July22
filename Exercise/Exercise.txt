1 when we remove static keyword: it will compile but not execute. It will show no such method error.
2 if the file name is different with the class name in the file, it will give compilation error.
3 when we use different type of literals for data types. Like float literal for integer data type, it will show error "Unresolved compilation problem: 
        Type mismatch: cannot convert from float to int".
4 JAVA BUZZWORDS;-
  1 SIMPLE - Java language is a simple programming language because: Java syntax is based on C++
  2 SECURE -  the Java language itself is type-safe and provides automatic garbage collection, enhancing the robustness of application code.
  3 PORTABLE - Java is known as a "portable language" because Java code can execute on all major platforms.
  4 ROBUST - Java is robust because it utilizes strong memory management.
  5 ARCHITECTURE-NEUTRAL - ava is an Architecture neutral programming language because, java allows its application to compile on one hardware architecture and to execute on another hardware architecture.
  6 HIGH PERFORMANCE - The performance of Java is impressive for an interpreted language because of its intermediate bytecode. Java provides high performance with the use of “JIT – Just In Time compiler”
  7 DISTRIBUTED - Java is distributed because it encourages users to create distributed applications.
  8 DYNAMIC - Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment.
