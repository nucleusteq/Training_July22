Designed classes should show below information:
a. If classes are related so we have to show case the relationship.
b. Classes should have member variables and methods to solve the above problem.
c. Commit your class diagram/code to GIT to showcase above system design in the below git repo with your name as branch name: https://github.com/nucleusteq/Training_July22.git 

3.2 We have to write a Java program to get the days pending to your birth date. Input will be your date and month of the birth and program will calculate how many days left to your birthday and commit your code onto git. 
e.g. My birth day and month is 1 Sep and today date is 29 July. So, days to birthdate will be 33 days.
