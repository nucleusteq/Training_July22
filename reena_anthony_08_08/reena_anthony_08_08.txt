1.He can use array.

2.String.

3. int[][] student = new int[12][n];

4.Using Static Keyword.

5. There are two types : Checked Unchecked.

6.class Throwable. 

7. The finally block in java is used to put important codes such as clean up code e.g. closing the file or closing the connection. The finally block executes whether exception rise or not and whether exception handled or not. A finally contains all the crucial statements regardless of the exception occurs or not.

8.  int[][] student = new int[12][40]; 
    for (int row = 0; row < student.length; row++) {
     for (int col = 0; col < student[row].length; col++) {
       student[row][col] = row * col;
    }
 }

10. Two data structures that immediately come to mind are ArrayList and LinkedList.

12. There are four ways to achieve Thread Safety in Java. These are:

*Using Synchronization.
*Using Volatile Keyword.
*Using Atomic Variable.
*Using Final Keyword.

13.Ways to create a multithreaded application:
   *Extending the Thread class 
   *Implementing the Runnable Interface

14.Deadlock can be prevented by eliminating any of the four necessary conditions, which are mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.

15. There are two approaches. The first is a 'quick fix' attempt.

1) Quick fix: Eclipse Memory Leak Warnings (catches some leaks)
2) Manually disable & enable parts of your code and observe memory usage of your JVM using a JVM tool like VisualVM (or Jconsole, or Thermostat).
