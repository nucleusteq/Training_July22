1. Different name of class and file will show this error-

	"message": "The public type Arthmetic must be defined in its own file"

2. If you remove the static keyword from  main method , the error will be -

	Error: Main method not found in the file, please define the main method as: public static void main(String[] args)

3. if you make any variable final you can not update it 
	

	"message": "The final local variable a cannot be assigned. It must be blank and not using a compound assignment",

4.if you assign the int variable with a character it will show this error -

	"message": "The local variable a may not have been initialized",

5. if you specify the main mehtod as private rather than public -

	"message": "The method main(String[]) from the type class name is never used locally"

6.if you use a try keyword without a catch block this error will be shown -

	"message": "Syntax error, insert \"Finally\" to complete BlockStatements"

7) Remove "class" from class definition - Error: Could not find or load main class FirstProg
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: FirstProg- This happened because without the keyword class in the class definition the compiler won't identify it as a class def. without which,
it won't load.


8) Remove main from main method - Error: Main method not found in class FirstProg, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application - This happened because main() 
method in Java is an standard method which is used by JVM to start execution of any Java program. 
Main method is referred as entry point of Java application which is true in case of core java application

9) Remove println - Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	The method out(String) is undefined for the type System
	at FirstProg.main(FirstProg.java:4) - This happened because Unresolved compilation problems in the code are due to compilation errors in the code,
 and java is looking for a method to run.

10) Remove semicolon - Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	Syntax error, insert ";" to complete BlockStatements

	at FirstProg.main(FirstProg.java:4) - This happened because Semicolon is a part of syntax in Java. 
It shows the compiler where an instruction ends and where the next instruction begins. 
Semicolon allows the java program to be written in one line or multiple lines, by letting the compiler know where to end the instructions.




If we change the class name while keeping the file name same we get this error - Error: Could not find or load main class FirstProg
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: FirstProg
