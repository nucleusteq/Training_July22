//WHY JAVA IS:
//​
// 1-Distributed:
// ->In Java, we can split a program into many parts and store these parts on different computers. 
// ->A Java programmer sitting on a machine can access another program running on the other machine.
//​
// 2-High performance:
// ->Java provides high performance with the use of “JIT – Just In Time compiler”, in which the compiler compiles 
// the code on-demand basis, that is, it compiles only that method which is being called.
//​
// 3-Architectural Neutral:
// ->its application to compile on one hardware architecture and to execute on another hardware architecture.
//​
// 4-Robust:
// ->There is automatic garbage collection in Java which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to eliminate objects which 
// are not being accepted by a Java application anymore.
//​
// 5-Portable:
// ->Java code can execute on all major platforms. 
//​
// 6-Simple:
// ->Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
//​
// 7-Secure:
// ->the Java language itself is type-safe and provides automatic garbage collection, enhancing the robustness of application code. 
// ->A secure class loading and verification mechanism ensures that only legitimate Java code is executed.
//​
// 8-Dynamic:
// -> Java programs can carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run-time.
